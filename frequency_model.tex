\subsection{Overview}
The frequency cost model uses the foundations of the maintenance cost model, but
replaces the unprioritized ordering with a prioritized ordering of frequency
cost, asymptotic runtime, max storage, true runtime, and true size. 

This model approaches optimization in a way that lets the user specify which
query or mutator is more important than the other, and calculates the costs of
expressions accordingly so that Cozy will find the implementation that is better
tailored to what the user thinks the specification will be used.
