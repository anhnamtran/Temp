During synthesis, Cozy uses a symbolic cost model to determine the costs of two
expressions given to it. It then makes several calls to a solver to determine
the order between the costs, that is, which one is better.

There are currently three versions of the cost model: the original cost model,
the maintenance cost model, and most recently, the frequency cost model.  The
original cost model refers to the cost model that Cozy currently uses for
running benchmarks. The latter two are modifications of the original model.
Based on several experiments, the maintenance and frequency models are slightly
worse than the original model, but introduces more fine-grained optimization.
